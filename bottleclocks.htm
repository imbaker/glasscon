  <h3>Bottle Clocks</h3>
  <div>
    <p style="clear: left">In 2004 we tried various materials in our kiln, to see what happened, and found a useful
      product in flattened bottles.</p>
      <img id="Stand" src=".netlify/images?url=images/clocks.jpg" alt="Nigel with his clocks" />
      <p>Here's Nigel with some of his clocks at Greenwich</p>
      <img id="BottleFront" src=".netlify/images?url=images/Bottle-Front-Small.jpg" alt="Front Bottle" />
      <p>It took a few tries to perfect the process, but we decided we had a product which could be developed and would
        sell. Clocks
        have been a feature of our product range since we started, so it seemed logical to make clocks from flattened
        bottles.
        The easy option is to flatten, drill, add the clock movement and numbers and, bingo, you have a clock. Being
        awkward,
        we wanted the original labels as well, so we spend a lot of time carefully removing labels, drying them and sticking
        them back on when the high temperature work is finished. We think the end product is worth it and looks great.
        Here's
        hoping you like our functional, decorative presents.</p>
        <p>Variations on labelled bottle clocks are also produced. We can make clocks with no labels, and a set of numbers,
          (best
          on dark bottles), memory bottles, (no clock), to hang on the wall (especially good for wedding and anniversary
          presents).
          Chopping boards/cheese boards can also be made and these look good when the original bottle has some embossing, such
          as Gordons and Bacardi bottles as this can be kept. There is no label on these, of course, unless you want the label
          on the back.</p>
          <p>All sorts of bottles can be used; beers, wines, spirits, mixers, olive oil, Marmite!, champagne and so on. You
            decide.</p>
          </div>
