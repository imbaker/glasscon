	<li>Introduction</li>
<p>We have been working with glass since 1991, mostly painting or producing stained glass items.  In the last two years we have moved over much more to the exciting world of “warm glass”.  This involves heating glass to the soft stage, around 820&deg;C, when layers of glass will fuse together.  The flat sheet of glass that is produced can be used for coasters, cheese or cake boards, wall plaques or included in stained glass windows.  In addition the flat glass can be reheated, at a lower temperature, and slumped into a mould to produce dishes, bowls, or other three- dimensional items.  When cool these are tough and versatile items to grace any household, but keep the essential beauty of glass and by the very nature of the production process are unique.</p>
<p>Other products we make, using similar techniques, are flattened bottle clocks, for which we have a separate page, and dichroic coated glass pendants and ear-rings.  This eye-catching jewellery makes wonderful presents for anyone.  A separate page for these is being developed, but they are notoriously difficult to photograph.  As each item is unique a general description only will have to suffice, much as wood turners can never duplicate the grain in their bowls.</p>
<p>We also produce fully washable painted glassware (vases, bowls, dishes, candle pots, water sets and other items) together with stained glass clocks, lamps, mirrors, etc. in a wide variety of colours and sizes. Lightcatchers are made in three types of glass: painted, stained and fused.  A selection of all these is usually available at the events we attend.</p>
<p>Our range of items is extensive, because the patterns, sizes and colours vary widely, so the best way to see them is to come to one of the events we attend.</p>
<p>You could try one of the days when we are in a hospital display area. These days, (weekdays), are handy if you want to collect something we didn't have available at a fair or to collect something you have ordered.  See our <a href="fairlist.htm"
